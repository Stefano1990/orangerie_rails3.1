module ActivityLogger

  # Add an activity to the livestreams of a user's contacts.
  # Usually, we only add to the livestreams of the contacts, not the user himself.
  # For example, if a user makes a forum post, the activity shows up in
  # his contacts' livestreams but not his.
  # The :include_user option is to handle the case when add_activities
  # should include the user as well.  This happens when
  # someone comments on a user's blog post or wall.  In that case, when
  # adding activities to the contacts of the wall's or post's owner,
  # we should include the owner as well, so that he sees in his livestream
  # that a comment has been made.
